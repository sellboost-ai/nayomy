## Jira MCP

An opinionated Jira MCP server built from years of real-world software development experience.

Unlike generic Jira integrations, this MCP is crafted from the daily workflows of engineers and automation QC teams. You'll find sophisticated tools designed for actual development needs—like retrieving all pull requests linked to an issue, managing complex sprint transitions, or tracking development information across your entire workflow.

This isn't just another API wrapper. It's a reflection of how professionals actually use Jira: managing sprints, tracking development work, coordinating releases, and maintaining visibility across teams. Every tool is designed to solve real problems that arise in modern software development.

## Installation

Copy this prompt to your AI assistant:

```
Install the Jira MCP server (https://github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp) for my Claude Desktop or Cursor IDE. Read the MCP documentation carefully and guide me through the installation step by step.
```

If your AI assistant cannot help with this installation, it indicates either a misconfiguration or an ineffective AI tool. A capable AI assistant should be able to guide you through MCP installation.

## CLI Usage

In addition to the MCP server, `jira-mcp` ships a standalone CLI binary (`jira-cli`) for direct terminal use — no MCP client needed.

```bash
just install-cli
# or
go install github.com/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp/cmd/jira-cli@latest
```

### Quick Start

```bash
export ATLASSIAN_HOST=your-instance.atlassian.net
export ATLASSIAN_EMAIL=you@example.com
export ATLASSIAN_TOKEN=your-api-token
# or
jira-cli --env .env <command> [flags]
```

| `list-sprints` | List sprints for a board |
| `get-worklogs` | Get worklogs for an issue |

| `get-history` | Get issue change history |

### Examples

```bash
# Get an issue
jira-cli get-issue --issue-key PROJ-123

# Search with JQL
jira-cli search-issues --jql "project = PROJ AND status = 'In Progress'" --max-results 20

# Create an issue
jira-cli create-issue --project PROJ --summary "Fix login bug" --type Bug

# Transition issue
jira-cli get-transitions --issue-key PROJ-123
jira-cli transition-issue --issue-key PROJ-123 --transition-id 31

# JSON output
jira-cli search-issues --jql "assignee = currentUser()" --output json | jq '.[].key'
```

## FOR AI

> THIS SECTION IS FOR AI ONLY

When working with this codebase, read these files to understand the project structure:

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Comprehensive project documentation including architecture, development commands, and coding conventions
2. **main.go** - Entry point that shows how the MCP server is initialized and tools are registered
3. **services/jira_client.go** - Singleton Jira client initialization and authentication
4. **tools/** - Individual tool implementations following consistent patterns
5. **docs/** - Detailed documentation (see structure below)

Key concepts:
- This is a Go-based MCP server that connects AI assistants to Jira
- Each tool follows a registration + handler pattern with typed input validation
- Tools are organized by category (issues, sprints, comments, worklogs, etc.)
- All Jira operations use the `github.com/ctreminiom/go-atlassian` client library
- Development principles documented in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

Before making changes, review:
- **CLAUDE.md** for architecture patterns and development commands
- **.specify/memory/constitution.md** for governance principles


## Quick start

### 1) Get an API token
Create one at `https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens`.

### 2) Add to Cursor
Use Docker or a local binary (STDIO; no ports needed).

#### Docker
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "--rm", "-i",
        "-e", "ATLASSIAN_HOST=https://your-company.atlassian.net",
        "-e", "ATLASSIAN_EMAIL=your-email@company.com",
        "-e", "ATLASSIAN_TOKEN=your-api-token",
        "ghcr.io/nguyenvanduocit/jira-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Binary
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jira": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/jira-mcp",
      "env": {
        "ATLASSIAN_HOST": "https://your-company.atlassian.net",
        "ATLASSIAN_EMAIL": "your-email@company.com",
        "ATLASSIAN_TOKEN": "your-api-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3) Try it in Cursor
- “Show my issues assigned to me”
- “What’s in the current sprint for ABC?”
- “Create a bug in ABC: Login fails on Safari”

## Configuration
- **ATLASSIAN_HOST**: `https://your-company.atlassian.net`
- **ATLASSIAN_EMAIL**: your Atlassian email
- **ATLASSIAN_TOKEN**: API token

Optional `.env` (if running locally):
```bash
ATLASSIAN_HOST=https://your-company.atlassian.net
ATLASSIAN_EMAIL=your-email@company.com
ATLASSIAN_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

HTTP mode (optional, for debugging):
```bash
jira-mcp -env .env -http_port 3000
```
Cursor config (HTTP mode):
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "jira": { "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp" } } }
```

### Limiting which tools are exposed (ENABLED_TOOLS)

By default every Jira tool is registered. To expose only a subset — for example, to hand an AI agent a read-only view of Jira — set the `ENABLED_TOOLS` environment variable to a comma-separated allowlist of tool names:

```bash
ENABLED_TOOLS=jira_get_issue,jira_search_issue,jira_get_comments
```

Rules:
- Unset or empty → all tools are exposed (backwards compatible).
- Whitespace around names is tolerated.
- Unknown names are ignored but logged at startup so typos surface immediately.
- Names that are not listed are simply not registered, so the MCP client never sees them.

Read-only agent example (exposes 15 reads, blocks all 8 mutating tools):

```bash
ENABLED_TOOLS=jira_get_issue,jira_search_issue,jira_list_statuses,jira_get_comments,jira_get_issue_history,jira_get_related_issues,jira_list_sprints,jira_get_sprint,jira_get_active_sprint,jira_search_sprint_by_name,jira_get_version,jira_list_project_versions,jira_get_development_information,jira_download_attachment,jira_list_issue_types
```
## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew install nguyenvanduocit/tap/jira-mcp
```
