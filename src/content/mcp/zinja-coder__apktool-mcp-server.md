## 🤖 What is apktool-mcp-server?

**apktool-mcp-server** is a MCP server for the [Apk Tool](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/apktool) that integrates directly with [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/anthropic/mcp) to provide **live reverse engineering support with LLMs like Claude**.

Think: "Decompile → Context-Aware Code Review → AI Recommendations" — all in real time.

Watch the demo!

- `get_smali_file()` — Get content of a specific smali file by class name. 
- `modify_smali_file()` — Modify the content of a specific smali file. 
- `list_resources()` — List resources in a project, optionally filtered by resource type. 
- `get_resource_file()` — Get Content of a specific resource file. 
- `modify_resource_file()` — Modify the content of a specific resource file. 
- `search_in_file()` — Search for a pattern in files with specified extensions.

## 🗒️ Sample Prompts


### 🔍 Basic Code Understanding

- “List all smali directories for the dvac project.”

- “Show me all the smali files under the package prefix com.vulnerable.component in the dvac project.”

- “Get the smali code for the class com.vulnerable.component.MainActivity.”

- “Compare MainActivity.smali with its previous version and show differences.”

- “Search for usage of startActivity in smali files of dvac project.”

### 🛡️ Vulnerability Detection

- “Analyze declared permissions in the dvac AndroidManifest.xml and flag dangerous ones.”

- “Search for hardcoded URLs or IPs in all .xml and .smali files in the project.”

- “Find all uses of PendingIntent.getActivity in smali files.”

- “Check for exported activities or receivers in dvac’s AndroidManifest.xml.”

- “List all smali files that access android.permission.SEND_SMS or READ_CONTACTS.”

### 🛠️ Reverse Engineering Helpers

- “Decode this APK: dvac.apk and create a project called dvac.”

- “Create a new APKTool project called test-harness.”

- “Clean the dvac project before rebuild.”

- “Extract DEX files from dvac project for external analysis.”

- “Modify MainActivity.smali to insert a log line at the beginning of onCreate().”

### 📦 Static Analysis

- “Get the complete AndroidManifest.xml from dvac project.”

- “Show the contents of apktool.yml for the dvac project.”

- “List all resource files of type layout.”

- “Search for the word password in all resource and smali files.”

- “Check which permissions are used and compare them against typical over-permissioning risks.”

### 🤖 AI Code Modification

- “Modify the onCreate() method in MainActivity.smali to add a toast message.”

- “Replace all http:// links with https:// in strings.xml.”

- “Add the android:exported=false attribute to all activities in the AndroidManifest.xml.”

- “Patch the method validateLogin in LoginManager.smali to always return true.”

- “Add logging statements to every method in MainActivity.smali.”

### 📄 Documentation & Metadata

- “List all decoded APKTool projects in the workspace.”

- “Show me the apktool.yml config to review the version, original APK metadata, and compression settings.”

- “Get all available Android devices connected via ADB. (To be migrated to ADB MCP Server.)”

- “Get metadata about the project dvac from its apktool.yml.”

- “Check which APKTool version is currently installed on the server.”

## 🛠️ Getting Started 
### 1. Downlaod from Releases: https://github.com/zinja-coder/apktool-mcp-server/releases

```bash
# 0. Download and install apktool
https://apktool.org/docs/install

# 1. Test whether apktool has been correctly configured in the environment variables
$ apktool -version

# 2. Download the apktool-mcp-server-<version>.zip
https://github.com/zinja-coder/apktool-mcp-server/releases

# 3. 
unzip apktool-mcp-server-<version>.zip

├apktool-mcp-server/
  ├── apktool_mcp_server.py
  ├── requirements.txt
  ├── README.md
  ├── LICENSE

# 4. Navigate to apktool-mcp-server directory
cd apktool-mcp-server

# 5. This project uses uv - https://github.com/astral-sh/uv instead of pip for dependency management.
    ## a. Install uv (if you dont have it yet)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ## b. OPTIONAL, if for any reasons, you get dependecy errors in apktool-mcp-server, Set up the environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    ## c. OPTIONAL Install dependencies
uv pip install httpx fastmcp

# The setup for apktool-mcp-server is done.
```

## 2. Running on Local LLM Using Ollama and Zin MCP Client - Recommended

<div align="center">
    <a href="https://github.com/zinja-coder/zin-mcp-client">
    
    </a>
</div>

⚡ Lightweight, Fast, Simple, CLI-Based MCP Client for STDIO MCP Servers, to fill the gap and provide bridge between your local LLMs running Ollama and MCP Servers.

Check Now: https://github.com/zinja-coder/zin-mcp-client

Demo: Coming soon...

## 🤖 3. Claude Desktop Setup

Make sure Claude Desktop is running with MCP enabled.

For instance, I have used following for Kali Linux: https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-debian

Configure and add MCP server to LLM file:
```bash
nano ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

And following content in it:
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "apktool-mcp-server": {
            "command": "/<path>/<to>/uv", 
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "</PATH/TO/>apktool-mcp-server/",
                "run",
                "apktool_mcp_server.py"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Replace:

- `path/to/uv` with the actual path to your `uv` executable
- `path/to/apktool-mcp-server` with the absolute path to where you cloned this
repository

Then, navigate code and interact via real-time code review prompts using the built-in integration.

## 4. Cherry Studio Setup

If you want to configure the MCP tool in Cherry Studio, you can refer to the following configuration.
- Type: stdio
- command: uv
- argument:
```bash
--directory
path/to/apktool-mcp-server
run
apktool_mcp_server.py
```
- `path/to/apktool-mcp-server` with the absolute path to where you cloned this
repository

## To report bugs, issues, feature suggestion, Performance issue, general question, Documentation issue.
 - Kindly open an issue with respective template.

 - Tested on Claude Desktop Client, support for other AI will be tested soon!
