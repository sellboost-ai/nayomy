# OMEGA

**Cross-model memory for AI agents. Local-first. Works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, Cursor, Claw Code, and any MCP client.** Your agent's brain shouldn't live on someone else's server, or be locked to one provider.

## The Problem

AI coding agents are stateless. Every new session starts from zero. The "solutions" either lock you into one model provider or send your codebase context to their cloud.

- **Context loss.** Agents forget every decision, preference, and architectural choice between sessions. Developers spend 10-30 minutes per session re-explaining context that was already established.
- **Repeated mistakes.** Without learning from past sessions, agents make the same errors over and over. They don't remember what worked, what failed, or why a particular approach was chosen.
- **Cloud memory = someone else's database.** Services like Mem0 require API keys and send your data to their servers. When they change pricing, get acquired, or go down, your agent's accumulated intelligence disappears.
- **Vendor lock-in.** Anthropic's Memory Tool only works with Claude. OpenAI's memory only works with GPT. Switch models, lose your memory.

OMEGA solves this. Memory, coordination, and learning that runs entirely on your machine. Works with every major LLM and coding agent. No cloud. No API keys. No vendor lock-in.

## Quick Install

```bash
pip install omega-memory[server]    # Full install (memory + MCP server)
omega setup                         # Downloads model, registers MCP, installs hooks
omega doctor                        # Verify everything works
```

### Claude Desktop

```bash
pip install omega-memory[server]
omega setup --client claude-desktop
```

This registers OMEGA as an MCP server in Claude Desktop's config. Restart Claude Desktop to activate.

### Cursor, Claw Code, Windsurf, Cline, Codex

```bash
pip install omega-memory[server]
omega setup --client cursor      # or: claw-code, windsurf, cline, codex
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Library-only install (no MCP server)</strong></summary>

If you only need OMEGA as a Python library for scripts, CI/CD, or automation:

```bash
pip install omega-memory    # Core only, no MCP server process
```

```python
from omega import store, query, remember

store("Always use TypeScript strict mode", "user_preference")
results = query("TypeScript preferences")
```

This gives you the full storage and retrieval API without running an MCP server (~50 MB lighter, no background process). Hooks still work:

```bash
omega setup --hooks-only    # Auto-capture + memory surfacing, no MCP server (~600MB RAM saved)
```

</details>

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omega-memory/omega.git
cd omega
pip install -e ".[server,dev]"
omega setup
```

`omega setup` will:
1. Create `~/.omega/` directory
2. Download the ONNX embedding model (~90 MB) to `~/.cache/omega/models/`
3. Register `omega-memory` as an MCP server (Claude Code auto-detected, or specify --client)
4. Install session hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json`
5. Add an OMEGA block to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

## 60-Second Quickstart

OMEGA works through natural language — no API calls, no configuration. Just talk to Claude.

**1. Tell Claude to remember something:**
> "Remember that the auth system uses JWT tokens, not session cookies"

Claude stores this as a permanent memory with semantic embeddings.

**2. Close the session. Open a new one.**

**3. Ask about it:**
> "What did I decide about authentication?"

OMEGA surfaces the relevant memory automatically:
```
Found 1 relevant memory:
  [decision] "The auth system uses JWT tokens, not session cookies"
  Stored 2 days ago | accessed 3 times
```

That's it. Memories persist across sessions, accumulate over time, and are surfaced automatically when relevant — even if you don't explicitly ask.

## Key Features

- **Memory & Learning** — Stores decisions, lessons, error patterns, and preferences with semantic search. Claude recalls what matters without you re-explaining everything each session. 25 memory tools including compaction, consolidation, timeline, graph traversal, and context virtualization (checkpoint/resume).

- **Multi-Agent Coordination** *(omega-pro)* — File and branch locking, session management, task queues with dependencies, intent broadcasting, and agent-to-agent messaging. 29 coordination tools that prevent agents from overwriting each other's work.

- **Intelligent LLM Routing** *(omega-pro)* — Classifies tasks and routes to the optimal model. Coding → Claude Sonnet. Quick edit → Llama 8b at 1/60th the cost. 1M token context → Gemini Flash. 5 providers, 4 priority modes, sub-2ms intent classification.

- **Knowledge Base** *(omega-pro)* — Ingest PDFs, markdown, web pages, and text files into a searchable knowledge base with semantic chunking.

- **Entity Registry** *(omega-pro)* — Multi-entity corporate memory with relationships, hierarchies, and entity-scoped memories/profiles/documents.

- **Secure Profile** *(omega-pro)* — AES-256 encrypted personal data storage with macOS Keychain integration.

<summary><strong>Advanced Details</strong></summary>

### Hooks (7 processes, 11 handlers)

All hooks dispatch via `fast_hook.py` → daemon UDS socket, with fail-open semantics.

| Hook | Matcher | Handlers | Purpose |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| SessionStart | all | `session_start` | Welcome briefing, session resume |
| Stop | all | `session_stop` | Summary |
| UserPromptSubmit | all | `auto_capture` | Auto-capture lessons/decisions |
| PostToolUse | Edit/Write/NotebookEdit | `surface_memories` | Surface relevant memories |
| PostToolUse | Bash/Read | `surface_memories` | Surface relevant memories |

> With omega-pro, additional coordination handlers register automatically: session lifecycle, file/branch claim guards, heartbeat, and git push guards.

### Storage

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.omega/omega.db` | SQLite database (memories, embeddings, edges) |
| `~/.omega/profile.json` | User profile |
| `~/.omega/hooks.log` | Hook error log |
| `~/.cache/omega/models/bge-small-en-v1.5-onnx/` | ONNX embedding model |

### Search Pipeline

1. **Vector similarity** via sqlite-vec (cosine distance, 384-dim bge-small-en-v1.5)
2. **Full-text search** via FTS5 (fast keyword matching)
3. **Type-weighted scoring** (decisions/lessons weighted 2x)
4. **Contextual re-ranking** (boosts by tag, project, and content match)
5. **Deduplication** at query time

### Memory Lifecycle

- **Dedup**: SHA256 hash (exact) + embedding similarity 0.85+ (semantic) + Jaccard per-type
- **Evolution**: Similar content (55-95%) appends new insights to existing memories
- **TTL**: Session summaries expire after 1 day, lessons/preferences are permanent
- **Auto-relate**: Creates `related` edges (similarity >= 0.45) to top-3 similar memories
- **Compaction**: Clusters and summarizes related memories

### Memory Footprint

- Startup: ~31 MB RSS
- After first query (ONNX model loaded): ~337 MB RSS
- Database: ~10.5 MB for ~242 memories

### What Gets Modified

`omega setup` modifies these files outside `~/.omega/`:

- `~/.claude.json` — Adds `omega-memory` MCP server entry
- `~/.claude/settings.json` — Adds hook entries
- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — Adds a managed `<!-- OMEGA:BEGIN -->` block

All changes are idempotent.

</details>

## Troubleshooting

**`omega doctor` shows FAIL on import:**
- Ensure `pip install -e ".[server]"` from the repo root
- Check `python3 -c "import omega"` works

**MCP server fails to start:**
- Run `pip install omega-memory[server]` (the `[server]` extra includes the MCP package)

**MCP server not registered:**
```bash
claude mcp add omega-memory -- python3 -m omega.server.mcp_server
```

**Hooks not firing:**
- Check `~/.claude/settings.json` has OMEGA hook entries
- Check `~/.omega/hooks.log` for errors

## Development

```bash
pip install -e ".[server,dev]"
pytest tests/                # 2198+ tests
ruff check src/              # Lint
```

## Uninstall

```bash
claude mcp remove omega-memory
rm -rf ~/.omega ~/.cache/omega
pip uninstall omega-memory
```

Manually remove OMEGA entries from `~/.claude/settings.json` and the `<!-- OMEGA:BEGIN -->` block from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
