# Discogs MCP Server

MCP Server for the Discogs API, enabling music catalog operations, search functionality, and more.

## Quickstart

If you just want to get started immediately using this MCP Server with the [Claude](https://claude.ai) desktop app and don't care about development or running the server yourself, then make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed and your Discogs personal access token ready and skip straight to the [Claude configuration section](#claude-desktop-configuration). Use the `NPX` method from that section.

## Acknowledgements

This MCP server is built using [FastMCP](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp), a typescript framework for building MCP servers. For more information about MCP and how to use MCP servers, please refer to the [FastMCP documentation](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp/blob/main/README.md) and the [official MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

## Available Tools

Check out the list of available tools: [TOOLS.md](TOOLS.md)

## Caveats

- The [Discogs API documentation](https://www.discogs.com/developers) is not perfect and some endpoints may not be fully documented or may have inconsistencies.
- Due to the vast number of API endpoints and response types, it's not feasible to verify type safety for every possible response. Please report any type-related issues you encounter.
- This MCP server allows for editing data in your Discogs collection. Please use with caution and verify your actions before executing them.
- The Discogs API `per_page` default is `50`, which can be too much data for some clients to process effectively, so within this project a `discogs.config.defaultPerPage` value has been set to `5`. You can request more data in your prompts, but be aware that some clients may struggle with larger responses.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (tested with Node.js `20.x.x`, but `18.x.x` should work as well)
  - Check your Node.js version with: `node --version`
- Docker (optional, for running a local docker image without having to deal with Node or dependencies)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example`
3. Set the following required environment variables in your `.env`:
   - `DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your Discogs personal access token

To get your Discogs personal access token, go to your [Discogs Settings > Developers](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers) page and find your token or generate a new one. **_DO NOT SHARE YOUR TOKEN_**. OAuth support will be added in a future release.

The other environment variables in `.env.example` are optional and have sensible defaults, so you don't need to set them unless you have specific requirements.

- `SERVER_HOST`: The host address to bind the server to (default: `0.0.0.0`). Set to `0.0.0.0` to allow connections from outside the container/machine, or `127.0.0.1` to restrict to localhost only.

## Running the Server Locally

### Option 1: Local Development

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Available commands:
   - `pnpm run dev`: Start the development server with hot reloading
   - `pnpm run dev:stream`: Start the development server with hot reloading in HTTP streaming mode
   - `pnpm run build`: Build the production version
   - `pnpm run start`: Run the production build
   - `pnpm run inspect`: Run the MCP Inspector (see [Inspection](#inspection) section)
   - `pnpm run format`: Check code formatting (prettier)
   - `pnpm run lint`: Run linter (eslint)
   - `pnpm run test`: Run vitest
   - `pnpm run test:coverage`: Run vitest v8 coverage
   - `pnpm run version:check`: Checks that the package.json version and src/version.ts match

### Option 2: Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t discogs-mcp-server:latest .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run --env-file .env discogs-mcp-server:latest
   ```

   For HTTP Streaming transport mode:
   ```bash
   # The port should match what is in your .env file
   # By default, the server listens on 0.0.0.0, allowing connections from outside the container
   docker run --env-file .env -p 3001:3001 discogs-mcp-server:latest stream
   ```

## Inspection

Run the MCP Inspector to test your local MCP server:

```bash
pnpm run inspect
```

This will start the MCP Inspector at `http://127.0.0.1:6274`. Visit this URL in your browser to interact with your local MCP server.

For more information about the MCP Inspector, visit [the official documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector).

## MCP Clients

More client examples will be added in the future. If you'd like configuration for a specific client, either
request it by opening a new issue or creating the pull request to edit this section of the README yourself.

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Find your `claude_desktop_config.json` at `Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config` and depending on which option you'd like, add **JUST ONE** of the following:

#### NPX

Running it straight from the npm registry.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discogs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "discogs-mcp-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Local Node

Dependencies should have been installed before you use this method (`pnpm install`).

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discogs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "tsx",
        "/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/FOLDER/src/index.ts"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Docker

The docker image should have been built before using this method.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discogs": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "--env-file",
        "/PATH/TO/YOUR/PROJECT/FOLDER/.env",
        "discogs-mcp-server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Any changes to local code will require Claude to be restarted to take effect. Also, Claude requires human-in-the-loop interaction to allow an MCP tool to be run, so everytime a new tool is accessed Claude will ask for permission. You usually only have to do this once per tool per chat. _If using the free version, long chats may result in more frequent errors trying to run tools as Claude limits the amount of context within a single chat._

### LibreChat

In the `librechat.yaml` configuration file, add this under the `mcpServers` section:

```yaml
discogs:
  type: stdio
  command: npx
  args: ["-y", "discogs-mcp-server"]
  env:
    DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN: YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE
```

### LM Studio

Get to the Chat `Settings`. In the `Program` tab there will be a dropdown with a default of `Install`. Select `Edit mcp.json`. Add this under the `mcpServers` section:

```json
"discogs": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "-y",
    "discogs-mcp-server"
  ],
  "env": {
    "DISCOGS_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN_GOES_HERE"
  }
}
```

After you Save, in the `Program` tab there should now be an `mcp/discogs` toggle to enable the server. Within every chat box there is an `Integrations` menu where you can also enable mcp servers.

## TODO

- OAuth support
- Missing tools:
  - Inventory uploading
