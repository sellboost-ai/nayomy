## Introduction

Agents are being connected to production systems, but without a consistent identity and access layer around them: limited access control, no auditing, and no standard access restrictions. Metorial solves that.

Metorial is a control plane for agent access to external systems. It sits between agents and integrations, handling auth, permissions, and observability in a consistent way. Instead of wiring integrations ad hoc, teams get a shared layer that standardizes how agents interact with systems.

## Core Capabilities

- **1200+ integrations** across SaaS tools, enterprise systems, data sources, and custom MCP servers.
- **Auth and token lifecycle management** for OAuth, API keys, service accounts, and other credential flows.
- **RBAC, SAML SSO, and IAM built in** so agent access follows your existing security model.
- **Scoped permissions** per agent, workflow, team, or environment.
- **Audit logs and traceability** for agent actions, including which agent acted with whose credentials.
- **Shared access patterns** across teams and projects instead of one-off integration code.

## Metorial for Developers

Metorial gives developers a single interface for connecting agents to real systems.

- Use integrations across tools like Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor without breaking security policies.
- Expose integrations as tools to any agent framework.
- Unify OAuth, API keys, and other auth flows into one magic URL.
- Reuse connections across projects, environments, and people.
- Avoid re-implementing integration and auth logic for every app.

You write against one API, or use one connection URL, and Metorial handles the rest.

## Metorial for Security

Metorial provides structure and visibility into how agents access systems.

- Centralized access control with RBAC, SAML SSO, IAM, and scoped credentials.
- Clear permission boundaries per agent.
- Audit logs for all actions, including which agent performed them using whose credentials.
- Controlled sharing of integrations.
- Consistent and secure credential handling.

This makes agent activity enforceable and inspectable without relying on manual processes. Makes your Head of AI happy, lets your CISO sleep at night.

## Ecosystem

- [**Metorial**](https://github.com/metorial/metorial): Integration catalog covering SaaS tools and enterprise systems.
- [**Metorial Platform**](https://github.com/metorial/metorial-platform): Core engine, open source and self-hostable.

## SDKs

The SDKs expose the Metorial API and integrate with agent frameworks.

They handle auth, access control, and tool exposure in a consistent way.

-  [**JavaScript / TypeScript**](https://github.com/metorial/metorial-node)
-  [**Python**](https://github.com/metorial/metorial-python)

If you want to build a custom integration, check out our [API documentation](https://metorial.com/api) for details on how to use the Metorial API directly.

## Self-Hosting

The [Metorial Platform](https://github.com/metorial/metorial-platform) is the code that powers the engine behind Metorial. It is open source and can be self-hosted. You can use it to run your own Metorial instance, powered by the MCP servers in this repo.

## Quick Start

The simplest way to get started is with **Metorial Search**, a built-in web search provider that requires no auth configuration.

### JavaScript / TypeScript

```typescript
import { Metorial } from 'metorial';
import { metorialAiSdk } from '@metorial/ai-sdk';
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { stepCountIs, streamText } from 'ai';

let metorial = new Metorial({ apiKey: process.env.METORIAL_API_KEY! });

let deployment = await metorial.providerDeployments.create({
  name: 'Metorial Search',
  providerId: 'metorial-search'
});

let session = await metorial.connect({
  adapter: metorialAiSdk(),
  providers: [{ providerDeploymentId: deployment.id }]
});

let result = streamText({
  model: anthropic('claude-sonnet-4-20250514'),
  prompt:
    'Search the web for the latest news about AI agents and summarize the top 3 stories.',
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10),
  tools: session.tools()
});

for await (let part of result.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(part);
}
```

Install it with:

```bash
npm install metorial @metorial/ai-sdk @ai-sdk/anthropic ai
```

### Python

```python
import asyncio
import os

from metorial import Metorial
from metorial import metorial_pydantic_ai
from pydantic_ai import Agent

async def main():
  metorial = Metorial(api_key=os.environ["METORIAL_API_KEY"])

  deployment = metorial.provider_deployments.create(
    name="Metorial Search",
    provider_id="metorial-search",
  )

  session = await metorial.connect(
    adapter=metorial_pydantic_ai(),
    providers=[{"provider_deployment_id": deployment.id}],
  )

  agent = Agent(
    "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    system_prompt="You are a helpful research assistant.",
    tools=session.tools(),
  )

  result = await agent.run(
    "Search the web for the latest news about AI agents and summarize the top 3 stories."
  )
  print(result.output)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Install it with:

```bash
pip install metorial pydantic-ai python-dotenv
```

## OAuth Integration

When working with services that require user authentication, such as Slack, GitHub, Google Calendar, or SAP, Metorial provides setup sessions to handle the OAuth flow and then reuse the resulting auth config.

### JavaScript / TypeScript

```typescript
import { Metorial } from 'metorial';
import { metorialAiSdk } from '@metorial/ai-sdk';

let metorial = new Metorial({ apiKey: process.env.METORIAL_API_KEY! });

let setupSession = await metorial.providerDeployments.setupSessions.create({
  providerId: 'your-slack-provider-id',
  providerAuthMethodId: 'your-slack-auth-method-id'
});

console.log(`Authenticate here: ${setupSession.url}`);

let completed = await metorial.providerDeployments.setupSessions.waitForCompletion([
  setupSession
]);

let session = await metorial.connect({
  adapter: metorialAiSdk(),
  providers: [
    {
      providerDeploymentId: 'your-slack-deployment-id',
      providerAuthConfigId: completed[0]!.authConfig!.id
    }
  ]
});

// Pass session.tools() to your model SDK.
```

### Python

```python
import os

from metorial import Metorial
from metorial import metorial_pydantic_ai

metorial = Metorial(api_key=os.environ["METORIAL_API_KEY"])

setup_session = metorial.provider_deployments.setup_sessions.create(
  provider_id="your-slack-provider-id",
  provider_auth_method_id="oauth",
  redirect_url="https://yourapp.com/oauth/callback",
)

print(f"Authenticate here: {setup_session.url}")

completed = await metorial.wait_for_setup_session([setup_session])

session = await metorial.connect(
  adapter=metorial_pydantic_ai(),
  providers=[
    {
      "provider_deployment_id": "your-slack-deployment-id",
      "provider_auth_config_id": completed[0].auth_config.id,
    }
  ],
)
tools = session.tools()
```

### OAuth Flow Explained

1. **Create a setup session**: Call `providerDeployments.setupSessions.create()` in TypeScript or `provider_deployments.setup_sessions.create()` in Python.
2. **Send the URL**: Show the setup session URL to users so they can authenticate in their browser.
3. **Wait for completion**: Wait for the setup session to finish and return an auth config.
4. **Use the auth config**: Pass the auth config ID when configuring `providers`.

### Provider Configuration Examples

Use the same `providers` list to combine dashboard-managed deployments, pre-created auth configs, inline credentials, and reusable session templates:

```typescript
let session = await metorial.connect({
  adapter: metorialAiSdk(),
  providers: [
    { providerDeploymentId: 'your-search-deployment-id' },
    {
      providerDeploymentId: 'your-slack-deployment-id',
      providerAuthConfigId: 'slack-auth-config-id'
    },
    {
      providerDeploymentId: 'your-github-deployment-id',
      providerAuthConfig: {
        providerAuthMethodId: 'github-auth-method-id',
        credentials: { access_token: 'ghp_...' }
      }
    },
    { sessionTemplateId: 'your-template-id' }
  ]
});
```

```python
session = await metorial.connect(
  adapter=metorial_pydantic_ai(),
  providers=[
    {"provider_deployment_id": "your-search-deployment-id"},
    {
      "provider_deployment_id": "your-slack-deployment-id",
      "provider_auth_config_id": "slack-auth-config-id",
    },
    {
      "provider_deployment_id": "your-github-deployment-id",
      "provider_auth_config": {
        "provider_auth_method_id": "github-auth-method-id",
        "credentials": {"access_token": "ghp_..."},
      },
    },
    {"session_template_id": "your-template-id"},
  ],
)
```

## Motivation

MCP is a powerful standard for connecting AI models to external data and tools, but it focuses on enabling AI clients (like Claude Desktop or Cursor) to connect to tools and data sources.
Metorial builds on MCP but makes it a one-liner for developers to connect their AI apps to any API, data source, or tool.
Thereby we enable developers to create agentic AI applications that can interact with other systems in a reliable, simple, and secure way.
