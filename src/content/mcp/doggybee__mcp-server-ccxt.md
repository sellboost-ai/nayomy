## CCXT MCP Server Integration Architecture

![CCXT MCP Server Integration Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doggybee/mcp-server-ccxt/HEAD/docs/images/mcp-integration.svg)

The CCXT MCP Server connects language models to cryptocurrency exchanges through the Model Context Protocol. It serves as a bridge that allows LLMs to access real-time market data and execute trading operations across multiple exchanges through a unified API.

The architecture includes:
- LLM clients (Claude and other MCP-compatible models) that send requests
- The Model Context Protocol (MCP) that standardizes communication
- The CCXT MCP Server that processes requests and manages exchange interactions
- The CCXT Library that provides unified access to exchange APIs
- Connections to multiple cryptocurrency exchanges

## CCXT MCP Server Code Architecture

![CCXT MCP Server Code Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doggybee/mcp-server-ccxt/HEAD/docs/images/code-architecture.svg)

The server is organized into three main modules for better maintainability and extensibility:

- **Exchange**: Manages exchange instances, credentials, and symbol validation
- **Utils**: Provides caching, rate limiting, and logging functionality 
- **Tools**: Implements MCP tools and resources for exchange interaction

## Quick Start

### Installing via Smithery

To install mcp-server-ccxt for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@doggybee/mcp-server-ccxt):

Alternatively, you can clone and build the repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/doggybee/mcp-server-ccxt.git
cd mcp-server-ccxt

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the server
npm run build

# Start the server
npm start
```

## Configuration

1. Create an environment file
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file to add your exchange API keys
   ```
   # Default exchange (optional)
   DEFAULT_EXCHANGE=binance
   
   # Default market type (optional)
   DEFAULT_MARKET_TYPE=spot 
   
   # API credentials (optional)
   BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key
   BINANCE_SECRET=your_api_secret
   # For exchanges requiring passphrase (e.g., KuCoin)
   KUCOIN_API_KEY=your_kucoin_api_key
   KUCOIN_SECRET=your_kucoin_secret
   KUCOIN_PASSPHRASE=your_kucoin_passphrase
   
   # Proxy configuration (optional)
   USE_PROXY=false
   PROXY_URL=http://username:password@your-proxy-server:port
   # Legacy format (still supported but recommended to use the integrated URL format above)
   # PROXY_USERNAME=
   # PROXY_PASSWORD=
   ```

## Usage

> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with MCP communication, please see the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting.md) for solutions.

### Running the Server

Start the server:

```bash
# If installed globally via npm
mcp-server-ccxt

# If installed manually
npm start
```

### Using with Claude for Desktop

1. Add the server to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

If installed via npm (globally):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ccxt": {
      "command": "mcp-server-ccxt"
    }
  }
}
```

If installed manually:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ccxt": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/mcp-server-ccxt/build/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Restart Claude for Desktop

### Using as a Module in Another Project

You can also use this package as a module in your own Node.js projects:

```javascript
// Import the CCXT MCP Server
import '@mcpfun/mcp-server-ccxt';

// The server starts automatically when imported
// You can configure it through environment variables
```

## Example Queries

Here are some example queries you can use with the MCP server:

- "What's the current price of Bitcoin on Binance?"
- "Show me the order book for ETH/USDT on Coinbase"
- "Get the 1-hour OHLCV data for BTC/USDT on Binance for the last 24 candles"
- "Compare the price of SOL/USDT across different exchanges"
- "What's my current balance on Binance?" (requires API keys)
- "Place a market buy order for 0.1 ETH on Kraken" (requires API keys)

## Performance Optimizations

MCP-CCXT includes several optimizations to ensure high performance:

1. **LRU Caching System**:
   - Different TTLs for different types of data
   - Ticker data: 10 seconds
   - Order book data: 5 seconds
   - Market data: 1 hour

2. **Adaptive Rate Limiting**:
   - Automatically adjusts request rates based on exchange responses
   - Implements exponential backoff for errors
   - Manages concurrent requests per exchange

3. **Exchange Connection Management**:
   - Efficient initialization of exchange instances
   - Proper error handling and retries

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Security

1. **Create Dedicated API Keys**:
   - Create separate API keys for different applications/purposes
   - Never reuse API keys across different services or applications

2. **Limit API Key Permissions**:
   - Enable only the permissions you need (e.g., read-only for market data)
   - Disable withdrawal permissions if you only need trading functionality
   - Use IP whitelisting when available to restrict access to known IPs

3. **Secure Storage**:
   - Never commit API keys to version control systems
   - Store API keys in environment variables or a secure vault
   - Use `.env` files that are excluded from git via `.gitignore`
