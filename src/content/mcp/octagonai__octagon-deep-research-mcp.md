```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "octagon-deep-research-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "octagon-deep-research-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "OCTAGON_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
4. Restart Claude for the changes to take effect

### Running on Cursor

Configuring Cursor Desktop 🖥️
Note: Requires Cursor version 0.45.6+

To configure Octagon Deep Research MCP in Cursor:

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Go to Features > MCP Servers 
3. Click "+ Add New MCP Server"
4. Enter the following:
   - Name: "octagon-deep-research-mcp" (or your preferred name)
   - Type: "command"
   - Command: `env OCTAGON_API_KEY=your-octagon-api-key npx -y octagon-deep-research-mcp`

> If you are using Windows and are running into issues, try `cmd /c "set OCTAGON_API_KEY=your-octagon-api-key && npx -y octagon-deep-research-mcp"`

Replace `your-octagon-api-key` with your Octagon API key.
