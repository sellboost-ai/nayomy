## Available Tools

The MCP server currently exposes the following tools:

### `octagon-agent`

Orchestrates public and private market intelligence analysis.

**Parameters**

- `prompt` (string, required): natural language research request.
- `conversation` (string, optional): existing Octagon conversation ID to continue a prior `octagon-agent` thread. Omit this on the first turn.
- `newConversation` (boolean, optional): if `true`, starts a fresh Octagon thread for the active session/thread anchor. Recommended for the first turn of a brand new visible chat in top-layer hosts such as Claude Desktop.

**Threaded usage**

`octagon-agent` is the only MCP tool that forwards Octagon conversation threading. It is a stateful tool and expects session continuity. The MCP resolves session/thread state in this order:

1. stored conversation for MCP transport session identity, when the transport actually provides it
2. stored conversation for the server-managed default `stdio` session
3. explicit `conversation` can still override the active session conversation for that call

This package currently runs as a `stdio` MCP server. In `stdio` mode, the server automatically establishes a process-local session for continuity across calls. Most local hosts such as Claude Desktop or Cursor can therefore use `octagon-agent` without supplying any extra threading fields for basic follow-up behavior.

When a top-layer host knows a call is the first turn of a new visible chat, it should pass `newConversation: true`. That explicitly clears any stored Octagon thread for the active MCP session anchor before the call, which prevents stale continuity when a `stdio` host reuses the same long-lived MCP process across multiple visible chats.

This means you can use any of these patterns:

1. First call: send only `prompt`
2. Let the MCP host preserve transport session continuity or rely on the default stdio session
3. Second call: either
   - send the new `prompt` in the same MCP session, or
   - keep using the same stdio MCP process, or
   - explicitly pass the previous `conversation`

Transport session identity is the canonical continuity primitive for standards-compliant stateful MCP transports. For local `stdio` usage, the server-managed process session provides default continuity.

Session identity and Octagon conversation identity are different concepts:

- MCP session identity controls server-side continuity across tool calls
- Octagon `conversation` controls the active Octagon thread inside that session

The MCP result keeps the answer in `content`, and also returns structured metadata for orchestrators in `structuredContent`:

```json
{
  "model": "octagon-agent",
  "text": "Which stock would you like the latest price for?",
  "conversation": "conv_123",
  "responseId": "resp_123",
  "followUp": {
    "required": true,
    "inputTemplate": "<ticker or company name>",
    "instructions": "Reply with just the missing detail and reuse the conversation value from this response."
  }
}
```

Explicit carry-forward example:

```json
{
  "prompt": "AAPL",
  "conversation": "conv_123"
}
```

New visible chat example:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Analyze Apple",
  "newConversation": true
}
```

Explicit refresh example:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Start a fresh Octagon thread for this chat",
  "newConversation": true
}
```

**Stateful tool policy**

- `octagon-agent`: stateful, uses a usable continuity anchor. In `stdio` hosts, that defaults to the server-managed process session unless you provide explicit `conversation`
- other MCP tools: stateless and may run without session continuity

Example:

```text
Compare NVIDIA and AMD on latest quarterly revenue growth, margins, and management commentary.
```

More examples:

- "What were Amazon's revenue and net income figures in Q4 2023?"
- "Analyze Tesla's R&D spending trends over the last 3 years."
- "What guidance did NVIDIA's CEO provide regarding AI chip demand in their latest earnings call?"
- "Compare the price-to-earnings, price-to-sales, and EV/EBITDA ratios for the top 5 semiconductor companies."
- "What was Anthropic's latest funding round size, valuation, and key investors?"
- "How many investments did Andreessen Horowitz make in AI startups in the last 12 months?"

### `octagon-deep-research-agent`

Performs comprehensive multi-source deep research and synthesis.

**Parameters**

- `prompt` (string, required): natural language research request.

Example:

```text
Research the impact of lower interest rates on late-stage private software valuations over the next 12 months.
```

More examples:

- "Extract all data fields from zillow.com/san-francisco-ca/"
- "Research the financial impact of Apple's privacy changes on digital advertising companies' revenue and margins"
- "Retrieve historical Bitcoin price data from 2023 and analyze the price volatility trends"
- "Analyze the competitive dynamics in the EV charging infrastructure market"

### `octagon-prediction-markets-agent`

Generates research reports for Kalshi prediction market events.

**Parameters**

- `prompt` (string, required): natural language research request.
- `cache` (boolean, optional): controls agent variant routing.
  - omitted: `prediction-markets-agent`
  - `false`: `prediction-markets-agent:refresh`
  - `true`: `prediction-markets-agent:cache`

Example:

```text
Generate a report for the Kalshi market https://kalshi.com/markets/kxbtcy/btc-price-range-eoy/kxbtcy-27jan0100
```

### `prediction_markets_history`

Fetches historical data for a prediction market event ticker with optional pagination and time filters.

**Parameters**

- `event_ticker` (string, required)
- `limit` (number, optional)
- `cursor` (string, optional)
- `captured_from` (string, optional)
- `captured_to` (string, optional)
- `include_analysis` (boolean, optional; when true, requests analysis columns)

Example:

```text
Fetch historical data for the Kalshi event https://kalshi.com/markets/kxbtcy/btc-price-range-eoy/kxbtcy-27jan0100
```

## Troubleshooting
