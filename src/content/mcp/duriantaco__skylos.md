## What Is Skylos?

Skylos is an open-source static analysis CLI for Python, TypeScript,
JavaScript, Java, Go, PHP, Rust, Dart, C#, Shell, and deployment config. It
runs locally by default and can also be used as a CI/CD PR gate.

Use Skylos when you want one command to check a repo or pull request for:

- dead code and unused files
- security flaws and dangerous data flows
- secrets and dependency CVEs
- CI/CD and edge-device deployment misconfigurations
- quality regressions such as complexity, duplicate branches, and deep nesting
- common AI-generated code mistakes, including missing guards and fake helpers
- LLM app risks such as unsafe tool use and missing output validation

## Start In 60 Seconds

```bash
pip install skylos
skylos .
```

The default scan focuses on dead code. Add security, secrets, quality, and
dependency checks with `-a`:

```bash
skylos . -a
```

Create a project config with thresholds, ignores, template hooks, and vibe
dictionary extensions:

```bash
skylos init
```

Create a starter local rule pack:

```bash
skylos rules init
skylos rules validate .skylos/rules/local.yml
skylos rules list --json
skylos rules list cross --json
skylos rules list --packs --json
skylos cache stats
```

Generate a GitHub Actions PR gate:

```bash
skylos cicd init
git add .github/workflows/skylos.yml
git commit -m "Add Skylos CI gate"
git push
```

## What Skylos Catches

| Category | Examples | Why It Matters |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Dead code | unused functions, classes, imports, package entrypoints, route handlers | reduces maintenance cost without breaking dynamic frameworks |
| Security flaws | SQL injection, XSS, SSRF, path traversal, command injection, unsafe deserialization | catches exploitable flows before code reaches main |
| Secrets | API keys, tokens, private credentials, high-entropy strings | prevents credentials from leaking through commits and PRs |
| CI/CD workflows | GitHub Actions and GitLab CI dangerous triggers, unpinned actions/includes, broad tokens, OIDC misuse, cache poisoning, mutable images | reduces CI/CD supply-chain risk before release jobs run |
| Edge deployment config | Docker Compose privileged device access, host networking, systemd root services, broad capabilities, missing sandboxing | catches repo-controlled settings that turn app bugs into device compromise |
| Quality regressions | complexity, deep nesting, duplicate branches, long functions, inconsistent returns | keeps AI-assisted refactors from adding brittle code |
| AI code mistakes | phantom security calls, missing decorators, unfinished stubs, disabled controls, network calls without timeouts | catches common hallucinated or incomplete code paths |
| LLM app risks | unsafe tool use, prompt injection exposure, missing output validation, missing rate limits | helps teams ship AI features with guardrails |

See the full [Rules Reference](https://docs.skylos.dev/rules-reference).

## How Skylos Fits

Skylos is not a replacement for every specialized scanner. It is a local-first
repo and PR checker that puts several common review checks behind one CLI.

- **Framework-aware dead code detection:** FastAPI, Django, Flask, pytest,
  SQLAlchemy, Next.js, React, package entrypoints, and common plugin patterns.
- **PR-focused output:** diff scanning, CI thresholds, GitHub annotations, and
  baselines for existing findings.
- **Local-first operation:** core static analysis does not require cloud upload
  or LLM calls.
- **AI-assisted change review:** checks for removed validation, auth, logging,
  CSRF, rate limiting, timeouts, and other guards in generated or edited code.
- **Project-specific rules:** add local YAML rules and extend prompt, credential,
  sensitive-file, and timeout dictionaries from config.
- **One command surface:** dead code, security, secrets, dependency, quality,
  technical debt, agent review, and AI defense commands share the same CLI.

## Install Options

```bash
# Core static analysis
pip install skylos

# LLM-powered agent workflows
pip install "skylos[llm]"

# All published optional extras
pip install "skylos[all]"
```

Container image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/duriantaco/skylos:latest
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work -w /work ghcr.io/duriantaco/skylos:latest . --json --no-provenance
```

See [Installation](https://docs.skylos.dev/installation) for source installs,
container usage, and optional dependencies.

## Configure Templates And Vibe Checks

Run `skylos init` to add these sections to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.skylos.templates]
# security = ".skylos/templates/security.md"
# quality = ".skylos/templates/quality.md"
# security_audit = ".skylos/templates/security_audit.md"
# review = ".skylos/templates/review.md"

[tool.skylos.vibe]
extra_phantom_names = ["verify_enterprise_auth"]
extra_phantom_decorators = ["tenant_admin_required"]
extra_credential_names = ["tenant_signing_secret"]
extra_network_timeout_calls = ["vendor_sdk.fetch"]
```

Template files extend Skylos' built-in prompts; they do not replace the
JSON-only output contract or untrusted-code safety rules. Vibe dictionary
extensions let teams teach Skylos about local fake-auth helpers, project
credential names, sensitive files, and network calls that must set timeouts.

By default Skylos discovers `[tool.skylos]` in `pyproject.toml` by walking up
from the scan path. To use a dedicated TOML config, pass `--config-file PATH`
or set `SKYLOS_CONFIG_FILE`; standalone files may use either `[tool.skylos]`
or top-level `[skylos]`. Synced Skylos Cloud policy keeps its protected
precedence over repository-controlled config.

## Benchmark Snapshot

Skylos has checked-in regression benchmarks for dead code, security, quality,
and agent review. These are strict regression gates, not broad proof that any
tool is universally state of the art.

| Suite | Current Skylos Result | Baseline |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Dead code regression | 16 cases, TP=36 FP=0 FN=0 TN=59, score 100.0 | Ruff score 62.67; Vulture not installed in latest local rerun |
| Security regression | 56 cases, TP=35 FP=0 FN=0 TN=23, score 100.0 | Bandit score 47.14 on Python-applicable cases |
| Quality regression | 13 cases, score 100.0 | regression gate only |
| Agent review | 25 cases, score 100.0 | regression gate only |

Frozen `golden-v0.2` highlights:

| Frozen Suite | Skylos Result | Caveat |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Dead code seeded dev | overall score 96.28; TS/JS/Go/Java score 100.0; Python score 93.33 | Python residuals are label-review items |
| Security seeded dev | overall score 96.52; full recall with one Python `urljoin` false positive | label should be reviewed |
| OWASP Java security dev | TP=105 FP=0 FN=15 TN=120, score 94.37 | request-wrapper, LDAP, XPath, and property weak-hash gaps remain |
| Quality seeded dev | TP=1 FP=0 FN=0 TN=1, score 100.0 | one seeded case only |

## Common Questions

**Does Skylos replace Bandit, Semgrep, CodeQL, or Vulture?**

No. Skylos can run alongside them. It focuses on framework-aware dead-code
signal, PR gating, AI-era regression checks, and a combined workflow across
dead code, security, secrets, and quality.

**Does Skylos require an LLM?**

No. Core static analysis runs locally without API keys. LLM features are
optional through `skylos[llm]` and agent commands.

**Can I use it only on changed code?**

Yes. Use `skylos . -a --diff origin/main` locally or configure CI gates to focus
on new findings.

**How should I handle intentional dynamic code?**

Use baselines, whitelists, inline suppressions, or runtime tracing. See the
[configuration docs](https://docs.skylos.dev/configuration) and
[smart tracing docs](https://docs.skylos.dev/smart-tracing).
