## Quickstart (npx)

Run the server directly from npm without a local installation. Requires Node **>=20**. Choose a transport:

### Option 1 – MCP client over STDIO

```bash
npx -y @pv-bhat/vibe-check-mcp start --stdio
```

- Launch from an MCP-aware client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.).
- `[MCP] stdio transport connected` indicates the process is waiting for the client.
- Add this block to your client config so it spawns the command:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibe-check-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@pv-bhat/vibe-check-mcp", "start", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2 – Manual HTTP inspection

```bash
npx -y @pv-bhat/vibe-check-mcp start --http --port 2091
```

- `curl http://127.0.0.1:2091/health` to confirm the service is live.
- Send JSON-RPC requests to `http://127.0.0.1:2091/rpc`.

npx downloads the package on demand for both options. For detailed client setup and other commands like `install` and `doctor`, see the documentation below.

## What is Vibe Check MCP?

Vibe Check MCP keeps agents on the minimal viable path and escalates complexity only when evidence demands it. Vibe Check MCP is a lightweight server implementing Anthropic's [Model Context Protocol](https://anthropic.com/mcp). It acts as an **AI meta-mentor** for your agents, interrupting pattern inertia with **Chain-Pattern Interrupts (CPI)** to prevent Reasoning Lock-In (RLI). Think of it as a rubber-duck debugger for LLMs – a quick sanity check before your agent goes down the wrong path.

## Overview

Vibe Check MCP pairs a metacognitive signal layer with CPI so agents can pause when risk spikes. Vibe Check surfaces traits, uncertainty, and risk scores; CPI consumes those triggers and enforces an intervention policy before the agent resumes. See the [CPI integration guide](./docs/integrations/cpi.md) and the CPI repo at https://github.com/PV-Bhat/cpi for wiring details.

Vibe Check invokes a second LLM to give meta-cognitive feedback to your main agent. Integrating vibe_check calls into agent system prompts and instructing tool calls before irreversible actions significantly improves agent alignment and common-sense. The high-level component map: [docs/architecture.md](./docs/architecture.md), while the CPI handoff diagram and example shim are captured in [docs/integrations/cpi.md](./docs/integrations/cpi.md).

## The Problem: Pattern Inertia & Reasoning Lock-In

Large language models can confidently follow flawed plans. Without an external nudge they may spiral into overengineering or misalignment. Vibe Check provides that nudge through short reflective pauses, improving reliability and safety.

## Key Features

| Feature | Description | Benefits |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **CPI Adaptive Interrupts** | Phase-aware prompts that challenge assumptions | alignment, robustness |
| **Multi-provider LLM** | Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenRouter support | flexibility |
| **History Continuity** | Summarizes prior advice when `sessionId` is supplied | context retention |
| **Optional vibe_learn** | Log mistakes and fixes for future reflection | self-improvement |

## What's New in v2.8.0 (Final Maintenance Release)

> **Maintenance Notice:** This project is no longer actively maintained. It remains fully functional and available under the MIT license. Community forks are welcome. For details, see the [Changelog](./docs/changelog.md).

- **Bug fix:** `check_constitution` now returns valid MCP content types (fixes #84)
- **Security:** All dependencies updated — resolves 14 npm audit vulnerabilities (axios, MCP SDK, diff, express, and transitive deps)
- **MCP SDK 1.26:** Updated to latest SDK with critical cross-client data leakage fix; HTTP transport adapter updated for compatibility

## Session Constitution (per-session rules)

Use a lightweight “constitution” to enforce rules per `sessionId` that CPI will honor. Eg. constitution rules: “no external network calls,” “prefer unit tests before refactors,” “never write secrets to disk.”

**API (tools):**
- `update_constitution({ sessionId, rules })` → merges/sets rule set for the session
- `reset_constitution({ sessionId })` → clears session rules
- `check_constitution({ sessionId })` → returns effective rules for the session

## Development Setup
```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/PV-Bhat/vibe-check-mcp-server.git
cd vibe-check-mcp-server
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
```
Use **npm** for all workflows (`npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm test`). This project targets Node **>=20**.

Create a `.env` file with the API keys you plan to use:
```bash
# Gemini (default)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
# Optional providers / Anthropic-compatible endpoints
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=your_proxy_bearer_token
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com
ANTHROPIC_VERSION=2023-06-01
# Optional overrides
# DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER accepts gemini | openai | openrouter | anthropic
DEFAULT_LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
DEFAULT_MODEL=gemini-2.5-pro
```

#### Configuration 

See [docs/TESTING.md]() for instructions on how to run tests.

### Docker
The repository includes a helper script for one-command setup.
```bash
bash scripts/docker-setup.sh
```
See [Automatic Docker Setup](./docs/docker-automation.md) for full details.

### Provider keys

See [API Keys & Secret Management](./docs/api-keys.md) for supported providers, resolution order, storage locations, and security guidance.

### Transport selection

The CLI supports stdio and HTTP transports. Transport resolution follows this order: explicit flags (`--stdio`/`--http`) → `MCP_TRANSPORT` → default `stdio`. When using HTTP, specify `--port` (or set `MCP_HTTP_PORT`); the default port is **2091**. The generated entries add `--stdio` or `--http --port <n>` accordingly, and HTTP-capable clients also receive a `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` endpoint.

### Client installers

Each installer is idempotent and tags entries with `"managedBy": "vibe-check-mcp-cli"`. Backups are written once per run before changes are applied, and merges are atomic (`*.bak` files make rollback easy). See [docs/clients.md](./docs/clients.md) for deeper client-specific references.

#### Claude Desktop

- Config path: `claude_desktop_config.json` (auto-discovered per platform).
- Default transport: stdio (`npx … start --stdio`).
- Restart Claude Desktop after installation to load the new MCP server.
- If an unmanaged entry already exists for `vibe-check-mcp`, the CLI leaves it untouched and prints a warning.

#### Cursor

- Config path: `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (provide `--config` if you store it elsewhere).
- Schema mirrors Claude’s `mcpServers` layout.
- If the file is missing, the CLI prints a ready-to-paste JSON block for Cursor’s settings panel instead of failing.

#### Windsurf (Cascade)

- Config path: legacy `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`, new builds use `~/.codeium/mcp_config.json`.
- Pass `--http` to emit an entry with `serverUrl` for Windsurf’s HTTP client.
- Existing sentinel-managed `serverUrl` entries are preserved and updated in place.

#### Visual Studio Code

- Workspace config lives at `.vscode/mcp.json`; profiles also store `mcp.json` in your VS Code user data directory.
- Provide `--config <path>` to target a workspace file. Without `--config`, the CLI prints a JSON snippet and a `vscode:mcp/install?...` link you can open directly from the terminal.
- VS Code supports optional dev fields; pass `--dev-watch` and/or `--dev-debug <value>` to populate `dev.watch`/`dev.debug`.

### Uninstall & rollback

- Restore the backup generated during installation (the newest `*.bak` next to your config) to revert immediately.
- To remove the server manually, delete the `vibe-check-mcp` entry under `mcpServers` (Claude/Windsurf/Cursor) or `servers` (VS Code) as long as it is still tagged with `"managedBy": "vibe-check-mcp-cli"`.

## Research & Philosophy

**CPI (Chain-Pattern Interrupt)** is the research-backed oversight method behind Vibe Check. It injects brief, well-timed “pause points” at risk inflection moments to re-align the agent to the user’s true priority, preventing destructive cascades and **reasoning lock-in (RLI)**. In pooled evaluation across 153 runs, CPI **nearly doubles success (~27%→54%) and roughly halves harmful actions (~83%→42%)**. Optimal interrupt **dosage is ~10–20%** of steps. *Vibe Check MCP implements CPI as an external mentor layer at test time.*

## Agent Prompting Essentials
In your agent's system prompt, make it clear that `vibe_check` is a mandatory tool for reflection. Always pass the full user request and other relevant context. After correcting a mistake, you can optionally log it with `vibe_learn` to build a history for future analysis.

Example snippet:
```
As an autonomous agent you will:
1. Call vibe_check after planning and before major actions.
2. Provide the full user request and your current plan.
3. Optionally, record resolved issues with vibe_learn.
```

## When to Use Each Tool
| Tool                   | Purpose                                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🛑 **vibe_check**       | Challenge assumptions and prevent tunnel vision              |
| 🔄 **vibe_learn**       | Capture mistakes, preferences, and successes                 |
| 🧰 **update_constitution** | Set/merge session rules the CPI layer will enforce         |
| 🧹 **reset_constitution**  | Clear rules for a session                                  |
| 🔎 **check_constitution**  | Inspect effective rules for a session                      |

## Roadmap

> **Note:** This project has reached its final maintenance release (v2.8.0). The roadmap below is preserved for community forks that may wish to continue development.

- **Structured output for `vibe_check`:** Return a JSON envelope such as `{ advice, riskScore, traits }` so downstream agents can reason deterministically.
- **LLM resilience:** Wrap `generateResponse` with retries and exponential backoff.
- **Input sanitization:** Validate and cleanse tool arguments to mitigate prompt-injection vectors.
- **Prompt externalization:** Move hardcoded prompts to configuration files for transparency and auditability (see PR #71).
