## Overview

This project provides:

- A data gateway for routing traffic to MCP servers with session affinity.
- A control plane for managing the MCP server lifecycle (deploy, update, delete).
- Enterprise-ready integration points including telemetry, access control and observability.

## Key Concepts

- **MCP Server**: A server implementing the Model Context Protocol, which typically a streamable HTTP endpoint.
- **Adapters**: Logical resources representing MCP servers in the gateway, managed under the `/adapters` scope. Designed to coexist with other resource types (e.g., `/agents`) in a unified AI development platform.
- **Tools**: Registered resources with MCP tool definitions that can be dynamically routed via the tool gateway router. Each tool includes metadata about its execution endpoint and input schema.
- **Tool Gateway Router**: An MCP server that acts as an intelligent router, directing tool execution requests to the appropriate registered tool servers based on tool definitions. Multiple router instances may run behind the gateway for session affinity.
- **Session-Aware Stateful Routing**: Ensures that all requests with a given `session_id` are consistently routed to the same MCP server instance.
- **Agents & Sessions (Preview)**: Optional, opt-in resources for running LLM-driven agents on top of registered MCP tools. *Agents* are metadata (system prompt + model + allowed tool list); *Sessions* are individual runs that stream events over Server-Sent Events. Disabled unless `FoundrySettings:Endpoint` is configured.

## Features

### Control Plane – RESTful APIs for MCP Server Management

#### MCP Server Management (Adapters)

- `POST /adapters` — Deploy and register a new MCP server.
- `GET /adapters` — List all MCP servers the user can access.
- `GET /adapters/{name}` — Retrieve metadata for a specific adapter.
- `GET /adapters/{name}/status` — Check the deployment status.
- `GET /adapters/{name}/logs` — Access the server's running logs.
- `PUT /adapters/{name}` — Update the deployment.
- `DELETE /adapters/{name}` — Remove the server.

#### Tool Registration and Management

- `POST /tools` — Register and deploy a tool with MCP tool definition metadata.
- `GET /tools` — List all registered tools the user can access.
- `GET /tools/{name}` — Retrieve metadata and tool definition for a specific tool.
- `GET /tools/{name}/status` — Check the tool deployment status.
- `GET /tools/{name}/logs` — Access the tool server's running logs.
- `PUT /tools/{name}` — Update a tool deployment and definition.
- `DELETE /tools/{name}` — Remove a registered tool.

#### Agent and Session Management (Preview, opt-in)

Available only when `FoundrySettings:Endpoint` is configured. See [Agents and Sessions](#agents-and-sessions-preview) below for details.

- `POST /agents`, `GET /agents`, `GET|PUT|DELETE /agents/{name}` — CRUD for agent definitions.
- `POST /sessions`, `GET /sessions`, `GET|DELETE /sessions/{id}` — CRUD for sessions.
- `POST /sessions/run` — Start a session and stream events (SSE).
- `POST /sessions/{id}/messages` — Continue an existing session with a new user message; streams events (SSE).

### Data Plane – Gateway Routing for MCP Servers

#### Direct MCP Server Access

- `POST /adapters/{name}/mcp` — Establish a streamable HTTP connection.

#### Dynamic Tool Routing via Tool Gateway Router

- `POST /mcp` — Route requests to the tool gateway router, which dynamically routes to registered tools based on tool definitions. The router itself is an MCP server with multiple instances hosted behind the gateway for scalability.

### Authentication & Authorization Support

The gateway provides entra id authentication and basic application role authorization for mcp servers and tools:

- **Read** access is granted to the resource creator, principals assigned the configured `requiredRoles` values (for example `mcp.engineer`), and anyone holding the mandatory administrator role `mcp.admin`. When `requiredRoles` is empty or omitted, only the creator and `mcp.admin` principals can read the resource.
- **Write** access is restricted to the resource creator or principals holding the `mcp.admin` role.

For step-by-step guidance on configuring Azure Entra ID (creating `mcp.admin` and other role values, assigning them to users or service principals, and supplying those values in adapter/tool payloads), see [docs/entra-app-roles.md](docs/entra-app-roles.md).

### Additional Capabilities

- Support for **Proxying Local & Remote MCP Servers**. See [examples and usage](sample-servers/mcp-proxy/README.md).
- Stateless reverse proxy with a distributed session store (production mode).
- Kubernetes-native deployment using StatefulSets and headless services.

### Tool Registration and Dynamic Routing

The MCP Gateway now supports **tool registration** with dynamic routing capabilities, enabling a scalable architecture for managing and executing MCP tools.

### How It Works

1. **Tool Registration**: Developers register tools via the `/tools` API endpoint, providing:
   - Container image details (name and version)
   - MCP tool definition (name, description, input schema)
   - Execution endpoint configuration (port and path)
   - Deployment configuration (replicas, environment variables)

2. **Tool Gateway Router**: A specialized MCP server that acts as an intelligent router:
   - Runs as multiple instances behind the gateway for high availability
   - Maintains awareness of all registered tools and their definitions
   - Dynamically routes tool execution requests to the appropriate tool server
   - Accessed via `POST /mcp` endpoint (without adapter name)

3. **Dynamic Routing**: When clients send MCP requests to `/mcp`:
   - The gateway routes requests to available tool gateway router instances with session affinity
   - The router analyzes the tool call in the request
   - Based on the tool definition, it forwards the execution to the correct registered tool server
   - Results are returned through the router back to the client

### Agents and Sessions (Preview)

> **Preview / single-replica.** This subsystem is opt-in and intended for evaluation and single-pod deployments. Built-in tools execute in-process inside the gateway pod, and per-session state (working directory, disk-quota counters) is local to that pod. Do not enable this in a multi-replica or multi-tenant production deployment without adding an out-of-process sandbox and shared session storage.

The gateway can optionally run LLM-driven *agents* that call registered MCP tools and a small set of built-in tools (`builtin:bash`, `builtin:read_file`, `builtin:write_file`). The agent CRUD endpoints (`/agents`, `/sessions` GET/DELETE/LIST) are always available, but **streaming session execution** (`POST /sessions/run`, `POST /sessions/{id}/messages`) is only enabled when `FoundrySettings:Endpoint` is configured. Without it, a streaming request fails fast with an `error` SSE event saying that Foundry must be configured.

#### Enabling

Add a `FoundrySettings` section to `appsettings.json` (or supply via environment variables):

```json
{
  "FoundrySettings": {
    "Endpoint": "https://<your-resource>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/",
    "DeploymentName": "gpt-4o"
  }
}
```

Authentication uses `DefaultAzureCredential`; grant the gateway's identity (managed identity in AKS, or your local user via `az login`) the *Cognitive Services User* role on the target resource. Tool-emitting models are required for any agent with a non-empty `tools` array — `gpt-4o`-class deployments are recommended.

#### Defining an agent

```http
POST /agents
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
  "name": "weather-helper",
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  "system": "You answer weather questions concisely.",
  "tools": ["mcp:weather"],
  "description": "Demo agent backed by the weather MCP tool."
}
```

`tools` entries are namespaced by prefix:
- `mcp:<tool-name>` — routes to a tool registered via `/tools`.
- `agent:<agent-name>` — delegates to another agent (subagent / Task pattern).
- `builtin:bash`, `builtin:read_file`, `builtin:write_file` — in-process built-ins (see *Built-in tools and limits* below).

Referenced `mcp:` and `agent:` resources are validated at agent create/update time: the call fails if the resource does not exist or the caller lacks read access, so an agent can never reference tools or peer agents the creator could not invoke directly.

#### Running a session

```http
POST /sessions/run
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: text/event-stream
```
```json
{ "agentName": "weather-helper", "input": "What's the weather in Seattle?" }
```

The response is a Server-Sent Events stream; each event is `event: <type>\ndata: <json>\n\n`. Event types include `Started`, `ToolCallStarted`, `ToolCallCompleted`, `TokenDelta`, `Completed`, and `Failed`.

To continue an existing session with a follow-up message:

```http
POST /sessions/{id}/messages
Content-Type: application/json

{ "input": "And in Portland?" }
```

#### Built-in tools and limits

When an agent lists `builtin:bash` / `builtin:read_file` / `builtin:write_file` in its `tools`, those built-ins run **in the gateway pod** under a per-session working directory. They are guarded by:

- A regex denylist for clearly dangerous shell operations (`sudo`, network egress, mounts, package managers, etc.). This is *defense-in-depth*, not a sandbox.
- 30s default / 120s max bash timeout; 16 KiB output cap per stream; 256 KiB max file size; 4 MiB total writes per session.
- Path resolution rejects absolute paths and `..` traversal.

For multi-tenant or production use, replace these with a real per-session sandbox (e.g. ephemeral pod, gVisor, firejail) — see the inline comments in `BuiltinToolExecutor.cs`.

## Getting Started - Local Deployment

### 1. Prepare Local Development Environment
- [Install .NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [Install and turn on Kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/features/kubernetes/#install-and-turn-on-kubernetes)

### 2. Run Local Docker Registry
   ```sh
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2.7
   ```

### 3. Build & Publish MCP Server Images
Build and push the MCP server images to your local registry (`localhost:5000`).
```sh
docker build -f sample-servers/mcp-example/Dockerfile sample-servers/mcp-example -t localhost:5000/mcp-example:1.0.0
docker push localhost:5000/mcp-example:1.0.0
```

### 4. Build & Publish MCP Gateway and Tool Gateway Router
(Optional) Open `dotnet/Microsoft.McpGateway.sln` with Visual Studio.

Publish the MCP Gateway image:
```sh
dotnet publish dotnet/Microsoft.McpGateway.Service/src/Microsoft.McpGateway.Service.csproj -c Release /p:PublishProfile=localhost_5000.pubxml
```

Publish the Tool Gateway Router image:
```sh
dotnet publish dotnet/Microsoft.McpGateway.Tools/src/Microsoft.McpGateway.Tools.csproj -c Release /p:PublishProfile=localhost_5000.pubxml
```

### 5. Deploy MCP Gateway to Kubernetes Cluster
Apply the deployment manifests:
```sh
kubectl apply -f deployment/k8s/local-deployment.yml
```

### 6. Enable Port Forwarding
Forward the gateway service port:
```sh
kubectl port-forward -n adapter svc/mcpgateway-service 8000:8000
```

### 7. Test the API - MCP Server Management
- Import the OpenAPI definition from `openapi/mcp-gateway.openapi.json` into tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/), or [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/).

- Send a request to create a new adapter resource:
  ```http
  POST http://localhost:8000/adapters
  Content-Type: application/json
  ```
   ```json
   {
      "name": "mcp-example",
      "imageName": "mcp-example",
      "imageVersion": "1.0.0",
      "description": "test"
   }
   ```

### 8. Test the API - MCP Server Access 
- After deploying the MCP server, use a client like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to test the connection. Refer to the guide: [Use MCP servers in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers). 
  > **Note:** Ensure VSCode is up to date to access the latest MCP features.

  - To connect to the deployed `mcp-example` server, use:  
     - `http://localhost:8000/adapters/mcp-example/mcp` (Streamable HTTP)

  Sample `.vscode/mcp.json` that connects to the `mcp-example` server
  ```json
  {
    "servers": {
      "mcp-example": {
        "url": "http://localhost:8000/adapters/mcp-example/mcp",
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- For other servers:  
  - `http://localhost:8000/adapters/{name}/mcp` (Streamable HTTP)  

### 9. Test Tool Registration and Dynamic Routing

#### Build & Publish a Tool Server Image

First, build and push a tool server image to your local registry:
```sh
docker build -f sample-servers/tool-example/Dockerfile sample-servers/tool-example -t localhost:5000/weather-tool:1.0.0
docker push localhost:5000/weather-tool:1.0.0
```

#### Register a Tool

Send a request to register a tool with its definition:
```http
POST http://localhost:8000/tools
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
  "name": "weather",
  "imageName": "weather-tool",
  "imageVersion": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Weather tool for getting current weather information",
  "toolDefinition": {
    "tool": {
      "name": "weather",
      "title": "Weather Information",
      "description": "Gets the current weather for a specified location.",
      "type": "http",
      "inputSchema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "location": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
          }
        },
        "required": ["location"]
      }
    },
    "port": 8000
  }
}
```

#### Verify Tool Deployment

Check the tool deployment status:
```http
GET http://localhost:8000/tools/weather/status
```

#### Test Tool Routing via Tool Gateway Router

Use an MCP client (like VS Code) to connect to the tool gateway router:

Sample `.vscode/mcp.json` that connects to the tool gateway router:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "tool-gateway": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The router will automatically route tool calls to the appropriate registered tool servers based on the tool name in the MCP request.

### 10. Clean the Environment  
   To remove all deployed resources, delete the Kubernetes namespace:
   ```sh
   kubectl delete namespace adapter
   ```

## Getting Started - Deploy to Azure

### Cloud Infrastructure
![Architecture Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/mcp-gateway/HEAD/infra-diagram.png)

### 1. Prepare Cloud Development Environment
- An active [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com) with **Owner** access
- [Install Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

### 2. Setup Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)

The cloud-deployed service requires bearer token authentication using Azure Entra ID. Follow these steps to configure an app registration.

#### Create and Configure the App Registration

1. Go to [App Registrations](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade)
2. Click **+ New registration**
   - **Name**: Choose a meaningful name, e.g., `mcp-gateway`
   - **Supported account types**: Select **Single tenant**
   - Click **Register**

3. Go to the app registration **Overview** and copy:
   - **Application (client) ID** — this is your API Client ID for deployment

#### Expose an API (Define a Scope)

1. In the left menu, go to **Expose an API**
2. Click **Add** next to **Application ID URI**, and leave it as the default value:
   ```
   api://<your-client-id>
   ```

3. Click **+ Add a scope**
   - **Scope name**: `access`
   - **Admin consent display name**: `Access MCP Gateway`
   - **Admin consent Description**: Any brief description
   - Click **Add scope**

#### Authorize Azure CLI & VS Code as a Client Application

To allow Azure CLI & VS Code to work as the client for token acquisition.

1. Still in **Expose an API**, scroll down to **Authorized client applications**
2. Click **+ Add a client application**
   - **Client ID**: `04b07795-8ddb-461a-bbee-02f9e1bf7b46` (Azure CLI)
   - **Client ID**: `aebc6443-996d-45c2-90f0-388ff96faa56` (VS Code)
   - In Authorized scopes, select the scope `access`
   - Click **Add**

#### Configure Application Role for Authorization
[docs/entra-app-roles.md](docs/entra-app-roles.md)

### 3. Deploy Service Resources

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fmicrosoft%2Fmcp-gateway%2Fmain%2Fdeployment%2Finfra%2Fazure-deployment.json)

**Parameters**
| Name              | Description                                                                                                      |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `resourceGroup`   | The name of the resource group. Must contain only lowercase letters and numbers (alphanumeric).                 |
| `clientId`        | The Entra ID (Azure AD) client ID from your app registration.                                                    |
| `location`        | *(Optional)* The Azure region where resources will be deployed.<br/>Defaults to the resource group's location.   |
| `resourceLabel`   | *(Optional)* A lowercase alphanumeric string used as a suffix for naming resources and as the DNS label.<br/>If not provided, it will be the resourceGroup name.<br/>**Recommendation:** Set this value as the default the same with resource group name and make sure resource group name contains only lower alphanumeric. |


The deployment will:
- Deploy Azure infrastructure via Bicep templates

   | Resource Name                 | Resource Type               |
   |-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
   | mgreg\<resourceLabel>         | Container Registry          |
   | mg-storage-\<resourceLabel>   | Azure Cosmos DB Account     |
   | mg-aag-\<resourceLabel>       | Application Gateway         |
   | mg-ai-\<resourceLabel>        | Application Insights        |
   | mg-aks-\<resourceLabel>       | Kubernetes Service (AKS)    |
   | mg-identity-\<resourceLabel>  | Managed Identity            |
   | mg-pip-\<resourceLabel>       | Public IP Address           |
   | mg-vnet-\<resourceLabel>      | Virtual Network             |

- Deploy Kubernetes resources (including `mcp-gateway`) to the provisioned AKS cluster

> **Note:** It's recommended to use Managed Identity for credential-less authentication. This deployment follows that design.

### 4. Build & Publish MCP Server Images
The gateway service pulls the MCP server image from the newly provisioned Azure Container Registry (ACR) during deployment.

Build the MCP server image in ACR:

```sh
az acr build -r "mgreg$resourceLabel" -f sample-servers/mcp-example/Dockerfile sample-servers/mcp-example -t "mgreg$resourceLabel.azurecr.io/mcp-example:1.0.0"
```

### 5. Test the API - MCP Server Management

- Import the OpenAPI spec from `openapi/mcp-gateway.openapi.json` into [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/), or [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/)

- Acquire a bearer token locally:
  ```sh
  az account get-access-token --resource $clientId
  ```

- Send a POST request to create an adapter resource:
  ```http
  POST http://<resourceLabel>.<location>.cloudapp.azure.com/adapters
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  Content-Type: application/json
  ```
  ```json
  {
    "name": "mcp-example",
    "imageName": "mcp-example",
    "imageVersion": "1.0.0",
    "description": "test",
    "requiredRoles": [] // Only creator and mcp.admin can access. Add roles (e.g. ["mcp.engineer"]) to grant read access to other principals.
  }
  ```

### 6. Test the API - MCP Server Access

- After deploying the MCP server, use a client like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to test the connection. Refer to the guide: [Use MCP servers in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers). 
  > **Note:** Ensure VSCode is up to date to access the latest MCP features.

  - To connect to the deployed `mcp-example` server, use:  
     - `http://<resourceLabel>.<location>.cloudapp.azure.com/adapters/mcp-example/mcp` (Streamable HTTP)

  Sample `.vscode/mcp.json` that connects to the `mcp-example` server
  ```json
  {
    "servers": {
      "mcp-example": {
        "url": "http://<resourceLabel>.<location>.cloudapp.azure.com/adapters/mcp-example/mcp",
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  > **Note:** Authentication is still required to access the MCP server, VS Code will help handle the authentication process.

- For other servers:  
  - `http://<resourceLabel>.<location>.cloudapp.azure.com/adapters/{name}/mcp` (Streamable HTTP)  

### 7. Test Tool Registration and Dynamic Routing

#### Build & Publish a Tool Server Image

Build and push a tool server image to ACR:
```sh
az acr build -r "mgreg$resourceLabel" -f sample-servers/tool-example/Dockerfile sample-servers/tool-example -t "mgreg$resourceLabel.azurecr.io/weather-tool:1.0.0"
```

#### Register a Tool

Acquire a bearer token:
```sh
az account get-access-token --resource $clientId
```

Send a request to register a tool with its definition:
```http
POST http://<resourceLabel>.<location>.cloudapp.azure.com/tools
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json

#### Verify Tool Deployment

Check the tool deployment status:
```http
GET http://<resourceLabel>.<location>.cloudapp.azure.com/tools/weather/status
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

#### Test Tool Routing via Tool Gateway Router

Use an MCP client (like VS Code) to connect to the tool gateway router:

Sample `.vscode/mcp.json` that connects to the tool gateway router:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "tool-gateway": {
      "url": "http://<resourceLabel>.<location>.cloudapp.azure.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```
> **Note:** Authentication is required. VS Code will handle the authentication process.

The router will automatically route tool calls to the appropriate registered tool servers based on the tool name in the MCP request.

### 8. Clean the Environment
To remove all deployed resources, delete the resource group from Azure portal or run:
```sh
az group delete --name <resourceGroupName> --yes
```

### 9. Production Onboarding

- **TLS Configuration**  
  Set up HTTPS on Azure Application Gateway (AAG) listener using valid TLS certificates.

- **Network Security**  
  Restrict incoming traffic within the virtual network and configure Private Endpoints for enhanced network security.

- **Service-to-Service Authentication**  
  The Tool Gateway requires a shared secret (`GatewaySettings:Secret`) to accept forwarded identity headers from the MCP Gateway. In production, generate a strong random value and supply it to both the `mcpgateway` and `toolgateway` pods via the `GatewaySettings__Secret` environment variable or a Kubernetes secret. Requests without a valid `X-Gateway-Secret` header are rejected with `401 Unauthorized`.

- **Telemetry**  
  Enable advanced telemetry, detailed metrics, and alerts to support monitoring and troubleshooting in production.

- **Scaling**  
  Adjust scaling for `mcp-gateway` services and MCP servers based on expected load.

- **Authentication & Authorization**  
  Set up OAuth 2.0 with Azure Entra ID (AAD) for authentication.
  Implement fine-grained access control using RBAC or custom ACLs for `adapter` level permissions.
