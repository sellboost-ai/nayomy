ROS-MCP-Server connects large language models (such as Claude, GPT, and Gemini) to robots, enabling bidirectional communication with no changes to existing robot source code.  

### Why ROS-MCP?

- **No robot source code changes** → just add the `rosbridge` node to your existing ROS setup.
- **True two-way communication** → LLMs can both *control* robots and *observe* everything happening on the Robot.
- **Full context** → publish & subscribe to topics, call services & actions, set parameters, read sensor data, and monitor robot state in real time.
- **Deep ROS understanding** → guides the LLM to discover available topics, services, actions, and their types (including custom ones) — enabling it to use them with the right syntax without manual configuration.
- **Works with any MCP client** → built on the open [MCP standard](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), supporting Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Cursor, and more.
- **Works across ROS versions** → compatible across ROS 2 (Jazzy, Humble, and others) and ROS 1 distros.

## 🎥 Examples in Action  

🖥️ **Example - Controlling the MOCA mobile manipulator in NVIDIA Isaac Sim**  
Commands are entered into Claude Desktop, which uses the MCP server to control the simulated robot.

🐕 **Example - Controlling Unitree Go2 with natural language**  ([video](https://youtu.be/RW9_FgfxWzs?si=8bdhpHNYaupzi9q3))  
The MCP server enables Claude to interpret images from the robot's cameras, and then command the robot based on human natural language commands.

🏭 **Example - Debugging an industrial robot** ([Video](https://youtu.be/SrHzC5InJDA))  
- Connecting to an industrial robot enables the LLM to browse all ROS topics and services to assess the robot state. 
- With no predefined context, the MCP server enables the LLM to query details about custom topic and service types and their syntax (00:28). 
- Using only natural language, the operator calls the custom services to test and debug the robot (01:42).
