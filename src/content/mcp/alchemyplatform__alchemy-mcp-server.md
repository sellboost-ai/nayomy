# Alchemy MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents to interact with Alchemy's blockchain APIs in a structured way. This allows agents to query blockchain data directly without writing any code.

</a>

## Remote MCP Server (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started is to connect to the hosted remote server at `https://mcp.alchemy.com/mcp`. It authenticates via OAuth — just sign in with your Alchemy account when prompted. No API key or local install required.

**Full documentation:** [alchemy.com/docs/alchemy-mcp-server](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/alchemy-mcp-server)

> **Note:** The hosted server at `mcp.alchemy.com` and this open-source repo are maintained separately and may not be in sync.

For any other MCP-compatible client, point it at `https://mcp.alchemy.com/mcp` using Streamable HTTP transport.

## Local STDIO Server

This MCP server creates a bridge between AI agents and Alchemy's blockchain APIs, allowing agents to:

- Query token prices and price history (including flexible time frame queries)
- Get NFT ownership information and contract data
- View transaction history across multiple networks
- Check token balances across multiple blockchain networks
- Retrieve detailed asset transfers with filtering
- Send transactions via Smart Contract Accounts (**requires configured wallet agent server**)
- Execute token swaps via DEX protocols (**requires configured wallet agent server**)
- And more!

### Quick Setup

To quickly set up the MCP server, use the following configuration in your MCP config file (typically in Claude Desktop or Cursor settings):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alchemy": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@alchemy/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "ALCHEMY_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration allows you to use the server without manually cloning the repository.

### Environment Variables

The MCP server requires the following environment variable:

- `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` - Your Alchemy API key (required for all blockchain data queries)

**For transaction and swap functionality**, you must also configure:

- `AGENT_WALLET_SERVER` - URL of a configured wallet agent server that handles Smart Contract Account operations

⚠️ **Important**: The `sendTransaction` and `swap` methods will not function without a properly configured wallet agent server. These methods require external wallet infrastructure to handle signing and broadcasting transactions.

## Available Methods

You can prompt your AI agent to use the following methods:

### Token Price Methods

1. **fetchTokenPriceBySymbol**
   - Gets current price data for tokens by symbol
   - Example: "What's the current price of ETH and BTC?"

2. **fetchTokenPriceByAddress**
   - Gets current price data for tokens by contract address
   - Example: "What's the price of the token at address 0x1234...5678 on Ethereum mainnet?"

3. **fetchTokenPriceHistoryBySymbol**
   - Gets historical price data for tokens with specific date ranges
   - Example: "Show me BTC price history from Jan 1 to Feb 1, 2023, with daily intervals"

4. **fetchTokenPriceHistoryByTimeFrame**
   - Gets historical price data using flexible time frames or natural language
   - Example: "Show me ETH price for the last week" or "Get BTC price for the past 30 days"

### Multichain Token Methods

5. **fetchTokensOwnedByMultichainAddresses**
   - Gets token balances for addresses across multiple networks
   - Example: "What tokens does 0xabc...123 hold on Ethereum and Base?"

### Transaction History Methods

6. **fetchAddressTransactionHistory**
   - Gets transaction history for addresses across multiple networks
   - Example: "Show recent transactions for wallet 0xdef...456 on Ethereum"

7. **fetchTransfers**

   - Example: "What NFT collections does 0xmno...345 have tokens from?"

### Transaction Methods

10. **sendTransaction**
    - Sends transactions via Smart Contract Accounts
    - **⚠️ Important**: Requires a configured wallet agent server with `AGENT_WALLET_SERVER` environment variable
    - Example: "Send 0.1 ETH to 0xpqr...678"

### Swap Methods

11. **swap**
    - Executes token swaps via DEX protocols (Uniswap)
    - **⚠️ Important**: Requires a configured wallet agent server with `AGENT_WALLET_SERVER` environment variable
    - Example: "Swap 100 USDC for ETH"
