# MCP Claude Code

An implementation of Claude Code capabilities using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Overview

This project provides an MCP server that implements Claude Code-like functionality, allowing Claude to directly execute instructions for modifying and improving project files. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol, this implementation enables seamless integration with various MCP clients including Claude Desktop.

## Features

- **Code Understanding**: Analyze and understand codebases through file access and pattern searching
- **Code Modification**: Make targeted edits to files with proper permission handling
- **Enhanced Command Execution**: Run commands and scripts in various languages with improved error handling and shell support
- **File Operations**: Manage files with proper security controls through shell commands
- **Code Discovery**: Find relevant files and code patterns across your project with high-performance searching
- **Agent Delegation**: Delegate complex tasks to specialized sub-agents that can work concurrently
- **Multiple LLM Provider Support**: Configure any LiteLLM-compatible model for agent operations
- **Jupyter Notebook Support**: Read and edit Jupyter notebooks with full cell and output handling
